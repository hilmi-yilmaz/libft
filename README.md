# Libft Project

Libft is a self-written library which contains the most important functions of the C Standard Library (libc). It also contains some other useful functions.

## Description

The function names have the following structure: ft + _ + C Library Function Name. To find information about a function, use the manpages together with the C Library Function Name. 

A lot of functions are not part of the C Standard Library. These functions do the following:

* ft_substr:  Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a substring from the string ’s’. The substring begins at index ’start’ and is of maximum size ’len’.
* ft_strjoin:
